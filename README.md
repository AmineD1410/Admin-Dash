# Admin-Dash
This project was done following the The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS Course. I have mainly used grid for the overall layout and Flexbox to better positions the elements inside the grid areas. I think this is a very good strategy to follow, as one of my goals going into this project was understanding when to use Grid or Flexbox. The color theme was taken from TailwindCSS.com and the icons from materialdesignicons.com
I am very happy with my overall progress and proud of this project as I feel like it is the first professional looking page I have made.
In total, this project took me 6 hours to make.
